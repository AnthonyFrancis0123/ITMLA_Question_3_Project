1. Load Images and Labels Function (`load_images_from_folder`):
   - Define a function named `load_images_from_folder` that takes a folder path and label as input.
   - Inside the function, use `os.listdir()` to iterate through the files in the folder.
   - For each file, load the image using `cv2.imread()` with `cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE` flag to read the image in grayscale.
   - Append the image to a list of images (`images`) and its corresponding label to a list of labels (`labels`).
   - Print the count of images loaded for each label.
   - Return the lists of images and labels.

3. Image Enhancement Function (`image_enhancement`):
   - Define a function named `image_enhancement` that takes an image as input.
   - Inside the function, apply histogram equalization using `cv2.equalizeHist()` to enhance contrast.
   - Apply adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) using `cv2.createCLAHE()` and `apply()` method to further enhance contrast locally.
   - Return the enhanced image.

4. Feature Extraction Function (`feature_extraction`):
   - Define a function named `feature_extraction` that takes a list of images as input.
   - Initialize a HOG descriptor using `cv2.HOGDescriptor()`.
   - Iterate through the list of images and compute HOG features for each image using `hog.compute()`.
   - Append the flattened HOG features to a list of features.
   - Return the list of features.

5. Feature Normalization Function (`feature_normalization`):
   - Define a function named `feature_normalization` that takes a 2D array of features as input.
   - Initialize a `StandardScaler` object.
   - Use `fit_transform()` method to compute the mean and standard deviation of the features and perform feature scaling.
   - Return the normalized features.

6. Train-Test Split Function (`train_test_split_data`):
   - Define a function named `train_test_split_data` that takes the features (`x`) and labels (`y`) as input along with optional parameters such as `test_size` and `random_state`.
   - Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` to split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Return the split data.

7. Classifier Training Function (`classifier_training`):
   - Define a function named `classifier_training` that takes the training features and labels as input.
   - Initialize a Random Forest classifier using `RandomForestClassifier`.
   - Fit the classifier to the training data using `fit()` method.
   - Return the trained classifier.

8. Classifier Testing Function (`classifier_testing`):
   - Define a function named `classifier_testing` that takes the trained classifier, testing features, and labels as input.
   - Use the trained classifier to predict labels for the testing features using `predict()` method.
   - Print the classification report using `classification_report()` from `sklearn.metrics`.

9. Main Code:
   - Load defective and defectless images and labels.
   - Apply image enhancement to all images.
   - Extract features from enhanced images.
   - Normalize extracted features.
   - Split data into train and test sets using `train_test_split_data`.
   - Train the classifier using `classifier_training`.
   - Test the classifier using `classifier_testing`.
